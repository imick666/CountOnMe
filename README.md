## Introduction

This project simulated a project handover. I had to :

- Refactor code to respect the MVC pattern.
- Finish the design and make it responsive.
- Finish the logic. Only the addition and the substraction worked.
- Write unit test for all the logic.

## Description

Count On Me is a calcutor. (Thank's captain obvious ^^)

## What I learned

- Work on existing project
- Write unit test
- Use NotificationCenter
- Use alerts
- Bonus:
    - In writting this reamde, I decided to automate screenshots. So I learn "Fastlane / snapshot" for the occasion ^^
